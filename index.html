        <span>1</span> The Lord is my shepherd.<br>
            I have everything I need.<br>
        <span>2</span> He gives me rest in green pastures.<br>
            He leads me to calm water.<br>
        <span>3</span> He gives me new strength.<br>
        For the good of his name,<br>
            he leads me on paths that are right.<br>
        <span>4</span> Even if I walk<br>
            through a very dark valley,<br>
        I will not be afraid<br>
            because you are with me.<br>
        Your rod and your shepherdâ€™s staff comfort me.<br>

        <span>5</span> You prepare a meal for me<br>
            in front of my enemies.<br>
        You pour oil of blessing on my head.[a]<br>
            You give me more than I can hold.<br>
        <span>6</span> Surely your goodness and love will be with me<br>
            all my life.<br>
        And I will live in the house of the Lord forever.<br>

                <h3>God takes care of his people</h3>
                <p> <span>1</span> The Lord takes care of me
                    like a shepherd with his sheep.
                    I have everything that I need.
                    <span>2</span> He takes me to green fields where I can rest.
                    He leads me to streams of water where I can drink.
                    <span>3</span> He gives me new strength in my life.
                    He is my guide to the right paths.
                    He does this to show that he is good.
                    <span>4</span> I may walk through a valley that is as dark as death.
                    But I will not be afraid of any danger.
                    This is because you are with me, Lord.
                    Your stick and your shepherd's pole make me feel brave.
                    <span>5</span> You prepare a big meal for me while my enemies watch.
                    You put olive oil on my head.
                    You bless me so much that my cup is completely full.
                    <span>6</span> I am sure that you will always be good to me.
                    You will love me all the days of my life.
                    That will never change.
                    I will live in the Lord's house for as long as I live.</p>
